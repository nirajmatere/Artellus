Mr. Chitling:[['At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and\nMr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy\nagainst Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.', "The countenance of the\nfirst-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired\ngreat additional interest from his close observance of the game, and\nhis attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling's hand; upon which, from time to\ntime, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances:\nwisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon\nhis neighbour's cards.", "Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close\nattachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his\ncompanion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master\nBates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to\nbe 'blowed,' or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some\nother neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application\nof which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling.", "'That's two doubles and the rub,' said Mr. Chitling, with a very long\nface, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket.", "'No more of it for me, thank 'ee, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I've\nhad enough.", 'said the Dodger, stopping short\nwhen there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling.', "'Not a bit of it,' replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of\ndiscourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply.", 'Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim\nof the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair\nwith such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the\nfloor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at\nfull length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former\nposition, and began another laugh.', "'What I mean to say, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the\nface, 'is, that that isn't anything to anybody here.'", "'So I _do_ do as she bids me,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I shouldn't have\nbeen milled, if it hadn't been for her advice.", 'The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened\nto assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the\ncompany, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.', 'But,\nunfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never\nmore serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a\nviolent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary\nceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender;\nwho, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose\nhis time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old\ngentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood\npanting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.'], [3, 0, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4], ['imperative', 'indicative', 'indicative', 'indicative', 'indicative', 'indicative', 'indicative', 'indicative', 'indicative', 'conditional', 'indicative', 'indicative']]
